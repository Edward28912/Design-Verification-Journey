I designed and verified a triangular sequence generator. 
This project produces a sequence of numbers that cyclically increase and decrease within two adjustable boundaries defined as limith and limitl.
If we were to connect the 'bcd' sequence to the input of a DAC (digital to analog converter) we would obtain a signal that increases or decreases in amplitude corresponding to the current number.
